# TODO

* configurable repos, teams
* exclude/mark archived repos
* check if `renovate.json` exists 
* last release (configurable)
* days since open or closed PRs from dependabot or renovate (last PR created/updated time) ... configurable, e.g. since last 3 months


## Edge cases
* ambiguous owner for repo: given repo with multiple admins, but no topics, then configurable / warning ?
